                    <p>
                        In a village, lived a carefree boy with his father. The boy’s father told him that he was old enough to watch over the sheep while they graze in the fields.<br>
                        Every day, he had to take the sheep to the grassy fields and watch them as they graze. <br>
                        However, the boy was unhappy and didn’t want to take the sheep to the fields. <br>
                        He wanted to run and play, not watch the boring sheep graze in the field.<br>
                        So, he decided to have some fun. He cried, “Wolf! Wolf!” until the entire village came running with stones to chase away the wolf before it could eat any of the sheep.<br>
                        When the villagers saw that there was no wolf, they left muttering under their breath about how the boy had wasted their time.<br>
                            The next day, the boy cried once more, “Wolf! Wolf!” and, again, the villagers rushed there to chase the wolf away.
                            <br>
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        The boy laughed at the fright he had caused. This time, the villagers left angrily. <br>
                        The third day, as the boy went up the small hill, he suddenly saw a wolf attacking his sheep. <br>
                        He cried as hard as he could, “Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!”, but not a single villager came to help him.<br>
                        The villagers thought that he was trying to fool them again and did not come to rescue him or his sheep. <br>
                        The little boy lost many sheep that day, all because of his foolishness.

                    <h2>Moral of the Story</h2>
                    It is difficult to trust people who lie, so it’s important to always be truthful.

                    <h1>Story: The Fox and the Stork</h1>
                    <img src="images/home-The-Fox-and-the-Stork.jpg" alt="home-The-Fox-and-the-Stork" height="200px" width="300px">
                    <p>
                        One day, a selfish fox invited a stork for dinner. Stork was very happy with the invitation – she reached the fox’s home on time and knocked at the door with her long beak.<br>
                        The fox took her to the dinner table and served some soup in shallow bowls for both of them. <br>
                        As the bowl was too shallow for the stork, she couldn’t have soup at all. But, the fox licked up his soup quickly.

                    <p>
                        The stork was angry and upset, but she didn’t show her anger and behaved politely. To teach a lesson to the fox, she then invited him for dinner the next day. <br>
                        She too served soup, but this time the soup was served in two tall narrow vases. <br>
                        The stork devoured the soup from her vase, but the fox couldn’t drink any of it because of his narrow neck. <br>
                        The fox realised his mistake and went home famished.
                </p>
                <h2>Moral of the Story</h2>
                A selfish act backfires sooner or later!
