                    A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down his body just for fun. <br>
                     This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry. <br>
                     He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse desperately requested the lion to set him free.<br>
                      “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.”<br>
                       The lion laughed at the mouse’s confidence and let him go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with them. <br>
                    They tied him up against a tree. The lion was struggling to get out and started to whimper. <br>
                    Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free. <br>
                    Both of them sped off into the jungle.

                <h2>Story: Count Wisely</h2>
                <img src="count-wisely.png" alt="count-wisely" width="150px" height="250px">
                <p>One day, king Akbar asked a question in his court that left everyone in the courtroom puzzled.<br>
                     As they all tried to figure out the answer, Birbal walked in and asked what the matter was. <br>
                    They repeated the question to him.
                </p>
                <p>The question was, “How many crows are there in the city?”</p>
                <p>Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar.<br>
                     He announced the answer; he said there were twenty-one thousand, five hundred and twenty-three crows in the city.<br>
                      When asked how he knew the answer, Birbal replied, “Ask your men to count the number of crows.<br>
                       If there are more, then the relatives of the crows must be visiting them from nearby cities.<br>
                        If there are fewer, then the crows from our city must be visiting their relatives who live outside the city.”<br>
                     Pleased with the answer, Akbar presented Birbal with a ruby and pearl chain.
                </p>
                <p><b>Moral of the Story</b><br>
                    Having an explanation for your answer is just as important as having an answer.
